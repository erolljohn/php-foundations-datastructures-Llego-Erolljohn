Project Purpose

This PHP project focuses on demonstrating the use of hash tables and recursion, two important concepts in programming. The hash table portion shows how key-value data can be managed efficiently for quick access and organization, while the recursion portion illustrates how a function can solve problems by repeatedly calling itself. The main.php script serves as the primary file that connects and executes both of these concepts in one program.

How to Run Each Part

The main.php script operates as the main entry point of the project, handling the execution of both the hash table and recursion components. It brings together the logic from the other two files and displays their combined results.
The hashtable.php script independently demonstrates how a hash table works â€” including data insertion, searching, and retrieval using associative arrays.
The recursive.php script focuses on recursion, running a function that calls itself to perform a process or calculation repeatedly until a base condition is met.
Each file can be executed separately to view its specific behavior, or run together through main.php to see the complete functionality.
